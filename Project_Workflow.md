## Workflow

### 1. Data Collection

1.1 **Web Scraping / API Integration**
- Use **BeautifulSoup** and **Scrapy** to scrape reviews from websites like Amazon and Yelp.
- Alternatively, utilize platform-specific APIs to fetch reviews.

1.2 **Storage**
- Store raw review data in a **PostgreSQL** or **SQLite** database.

### 2. Data Processing

2.1 **Sentiment Analysis**
- Implement Python-based ML models to analyze the sentiment of each review (positive, negative, neutral).

2.2 **Text Summarization**
- Use Python-based models to generate summarized insights for each product based on the collected reviews.

### 3. Backend Development

3.1 **Django Setup**
- Set up a **Django** project and integrate **Django REST Framework (DRF)** to create APIs for the frontend to interact with the backend.

3.2 **API Development**
- Develop APIs to:
  - Retrieve raw reviews.
  - Provide sentiment analysis results.
  - Serve summarized insights and ratings.
  - Fetch real-time and periodically updated data.

### 4. Frontend Development

4.1 **React Setup**
- Set up a **React** project with **Tailwind CSS** for styling.

4.2 **UI Development**
- Develop a user-friendly interface to display:
  - Product reviews.
  - Sentiment analysis results.
  - Summarized insights and ratings.
  - Interactive charts and graphs for visualizing review data.

### 5. Real-time and Periodic Updates

5.1 **Cron Jobs with Celery**
- Implement **Celery** to schedule and manage real-time and periodic data updates.
- Set up tasks to:
  - Fetch new reviews at regular intervals.
  - Update sentiment analysis and summarized insights periodically.

### 6. Visualization

6.1 **Interactive Charts and Graphs**
- Use libraries like **Chart.js** or **D3.js** in the frontend to create interactive visualizations for review data.

### 7. Deployment

7.1 **Deployment Setup**
- Choose a deployment platform (AWS, Heroku, Vercel, Netlify) based on project requirements.
- Set up CI/CD pipelines for seamless deployment and updates.

7.2 **Configuration**
- Configure the backend and frontend to work together on the chosen deployment platform.
- Ensure that the database, cron jobs, and APIs are correctly set up and running.

### 8. Maintenance and Monitoring

8.1 **Monitoring**
- Set up monitoring tools to track the performance and health of the application.

8.2 **Maintenance**
- Regularly update the web scraping scripts, ML models, and application code to maintain accuracy and efficiency.
